//These, you need to rename for the application to work:
SONG				=	SONG_[SONGNAME]
INTRO TO SONG			=	INTRO_[SONGNAME]_[NUMBER]

//These, you can export directly from OpenIV without the need to rename:
STINGER				=	ID_[NUMBER]
GENERAL QUOTE			=	GENERAL_[NUMBER] or MONO_SOLO_[NUMBER]
MORNING				=	MORNING_[NUMBER]
EVENING				=	EVENING_[NUMBER]
TO ADVERTISEMENT		=	TO_AD_[NUMBER]
TO NEWS				=	TO_NEWS_[NUMBER]
ADVERTISEMENTS			= 	All in folder RADIO_ADVERTS
NEWS				=	All in folder RADIO_NEWS

//The stations I have already done:
RADIO_01_CLASS_ROCK
RADIO_02_POP
RADIO_03_HIPHOP_NEW
RADIO_04_PUNK
RADIO_05_TALK_01 //For talk radio, you need to only set SONG and STINGER, the other categories are not present. I still need to make implementation for this in the application.
