# GTARadioForDesktop
Ever wanted the radio from GTA V in a desktop application for Windows? Probably not, but here it is anyway!

### Installing / using the application

I have a pre-built version here: [here](/built_application/program/)

To use the application, you have to export all the audio files from GTA V with OpenIV. The radio files are located in GTA V/x64/audio/sfx/. You will need to export all the audio files from all the .rpf archives starting with RADIO_

Once exported, you need to put them in folders with the same names they have as .rpf archives.
